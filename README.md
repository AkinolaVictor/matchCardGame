# MEMORY GAME PROJECT
 
## ABOUT MEMORY GAME
* This game is built to test the player's Memory.
* This is a game aimed at improving your retentiveness.

## How to Play
Play the Game in your browser through this link https://akinolavictor.github.io/matchCardGame/

## playing Instructions
* Click on card to know the content it covers.
* Keep showing cards and try as much as possible to see that you do not forget each card's position.
* Each card has its own pair, so to have a match, you need two cards of the same content.

## How I Made The Memory Game
* I used javascript(Vanilla JS) to manipulate the DOM, So i altered the HTML content.
* I created a card container which holds all the cards and allow them to be shuffled when the game is refreshed.
* I created a Move counter and a Timer, the counter starts when a pair of card is revealed and the timer starts when a move is made and stops when the game Ends.
* I made a star container to hold the stars, to compensate the player based on the number of moves they made on completetion of the Game
* I added CSS effects to the cards, to tell when the cards match and are unmatched.
* I also made a pop-up message for when the player wins the game.
